# Keyman Browser

**Keyman Browser** is a mobile web browser for Android with built-in **font replacement** support. By using Keyman keyboards, fonts for specific scripts can be injected directly into the browser, ensuring proper rendering of text and eliminating the dreaded "square box" problem. This makes browsing in different languages smoother and more visually consistent.

Keyman Browser is part of the larger [Keyman](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyman) ecosystem, which provides cross-platform input methods and keyboard layouts for hundreds of languages worldwide.
